Movies API using C# and .Net Core  server side code and React with TypeScript client side


I am developing a project which displays the movies from an external API.
I am using C# as the backend server code which interacts with the externa API And the front end is in React with Typescript. 
The client side retrieves the movies from the C# API end points which further gets the movies from the external API.
From server end, I am using Depency Injection, Interfaces which makes coding more enjoyable and testable I wanted to use Generic interfaces but then i am not talking to the database plus I do not have many models doing the same thing. 
It is really cool.
